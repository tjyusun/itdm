            The word <em>discrete</em> in the title of our course means <em>separate</em>; something that is <em>not smooth</em>.
        
            In the study of discrete mathematics we will typically concern ourselves with discrete objects such as the integers, graphs, finite and countable sets. (In contrast, excluded from this are objects that may vary continuously, such as those ones covered in trigonometry, calculus, and Euclidean geometry.)

    <title>Review of MAT102</title>
        <introduction>
        <p>
            Many of the concepts you learned in your MAT102 course will be useful in MAT202; in this chapter we briefly review some definitions and results, and present some exercises to warm up for the rest of the course! Material in this chapter is based on <em>MAT102H5 Introduction to Mathematical Proofs</em> by <em>Shay Fuchs.</em>

            A <term>set</term> is is just a collection of objects (where the order in which the objects are listed does not matter). The following set operations should be familiar to you: intersection <m>A \cap B</m>, union <m>A \cup B</m>, complement <m>A^c</m>, difference <m>A \ \backslash \ B</m>, and Cartesian product <m>A \times B</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also recall that proving the set <m>A</m> is a subset of the set <m>B</m> simply necessitates showing that any element of <m>A</m> can also be found in <m>B</m>.

            We will use the standard notation for these sets of numbers:
            <md>
                <mrow> \mathbb{N} \amp = \{1,2,3,\ldots,\}</mrow>
                <mrow> \mathbb{Z} \amp = \{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}</mrow>
                <mrow> \mathbb{Q} \amp = \left\{\dfrac{p}{q} : p,q \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}</mrow>
                <mrow> \mathbb{R} \amp = (-\infty,\infty), \text{ the set of real numbers.}</mrow>
            </md>
            Intervals of real numbers are denoted by <m>(a,b), [a,b],</m> and other combinations, with <m>-\infty</m> or <m>\infty</m> as one of both of the endpoints.
        </p>

        <remark>
            <p>
                Interval notation is used to refer to sets of real numbers.
                It is <em>incorrect</em>, for instance, to say that <m>(-2,4) = \{-1,0,1,2,3\}</m>, or that <m>\{0,1,2,3,\ldots\} = [0,\infty)</m>.
                Watch your notation!

            Mathematical statements can typically be phrased as an implication <m>P \Rightarrow Q</m>,  read as <em>if <m>P</m>, then <m>Q</m></em>,
            where <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m> may be complex statements themselves that involve conjunctions (and), disjunctions (or), negations, quantifiers, even implications.
            There are various ways in which an implication can be proven true, and there is no hard and fast rule that dictates which proof method to use given a particular problem.
            In MAT102 you were introduced to the following proof techniques:
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> Direct proof: Assume <m>P</m> is true, then prove <m>Q</m> is true.</li>
                <li> Contrapositive: Assume <m>\neg Q</m> is true, then prove <m>\neg P</m> is true.</li>
                <li> Contradiction: Assume the conclusion is false, then use this to arrive at a statement that contradicts one of the assumptions.</li>

        <p>
            Many of these statements are <em>quantified</em> universally, which means it involves some variable (say <m>n</m>), and you need to prove the claim holds for all relevant values of the variable (say <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>). 
            For 1, 2, and 4, for example, the relevant quantities are integers; the statements need to be proven for all integers.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use mathematical induction to prove that a statement is true for all natural numbers.
        </p>

        <theorem xml:id="thm-induction">
            <title> Principle of Mathematical Induction </title>
            <p>
                Let <m>P(n)</m> be a predicate defined for <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
                If the following conditions hold:
                <ol label="(a)">
                    <li><m>P(1)</m> is true;</li>
                    <li> For all <m> k \in \mathbb{N}</m>, <m>P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)</m> is true.</li>
                </ol>
                then <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One can also replace the second condition with the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                b.* For all <m>k \in \mathbb{N}</m>, <m>[P(1) \wedge P(2) \wedge \cdots \wedge P(k)] \Rightarrow P(k+1)</m> is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is called <term>strong induction</term>, where one assumes the induction step holds for all natural numbers from 1 to <m>k</m> in order to prove the claim for <m>k+1</m>.
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <p>
            Depending on what is being proved, one may need to make slight modifications to the standard technique: e.g. changing/adding to the base case, or <q>skipping</q> from <m>k</m> to <m>k+2</m> in the case when one only has to prove the claim for every other natural number starting from the base case.

                (<m>\Rightarrow</m>)
                <m>m = 2k \Rightarrow m^3 = 8k^3 = 2(4k^3)</m>, so <m>m^3</m> is even.
            </p>
            <p>
                (<m>\Leftarrow</m>)
                By contradiction. Assume <m>m^3</m> is even but <m>m</m> is odd.
                Then <m>m = 2k + 1 \Rightarrow m^3 =(2k+1)^3 = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1</m>, which is odd.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contradiction, so <m>m</m> must be even.
                So <m>m</m> even <m>\Leftrightarrow</m> <m>m^3</m> even.

                <alert>Proof 2</alert>
                <me>m \text{ even } \Leftrightarrow m = 2k \Leftrightarrow m^3 = 8k^3 \Leftrightarrow  m^3 = 2(4k^3) \Leftrightarrow  m^3 \text{ even}</me>, hence proven.

            <p>
                <alert>Proof 3</alert>
                We want to prove that <me>m \text{ is even if and only if } m^3 \text{ is even}</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
                (<m>\Rightarrow</m>) First, we show <m>m</m> even <m>\Rightarrow</m> <m>m^3</m> even.

                If <m>m</m> is even, then we can write <m>m = 2k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>.
                Then,
                <md>
                    <mrow>m^3 \amp = (2k)^3</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = 8k^3</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3)</mrow>
                </md>.
                Since <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, then <m>4k^3 \in \mathbb{Z}</m> as well, and so <m>m^3</m> is even.
            </p>
            <p>
                (<m>\Leftarrow</m>)
                Next, we prove that <m>m^3</m> even <m>\Rightarrow</m> <m>m</m> even.
                To do this we prove the contrapositive: If <m>m</m> is odd, then <m>m^3</m> is odd.
            </p>
            <p>
                If <m>m</m> is odd, then there is a <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m>m = 2k + 1</m>.
                Then
                <md>
                    <mrow>m^3 \amp = (2k+1)^3</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1</mrow>
                </md>.
                Since <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, then <m>4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> as well.
                Therefore <m>m^3</m> is odd.

                This completes the proof.

        If the two sides of a right triangle have lengths <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and the hypotenuse has length <m>c</m>, then the equation <me> a^2 + b^2 = c^2</me> will always hold.
