		A new format for passenger vehicle licence plates issued in the province is being proposed, that adheres to the following conditions:
		<ul>
			<li>Pattern is AB123-4CD (or letter-letter-digit-digit-digit--digit-letter-letter).</li>
			<li>The letters G, I, O, Q and U cannot be used.</li>
			<li>The first digit cannot be a zero.</li>
			<li>The last two letters must be different.</li>
		</ul>
		How many licence plates combinations are possible that satisfy all these conditions?
	</p>
</statement>
<solution>
	<p>
		Only 21 letters are available to pick from, so there are <m>21^2</m> possible letter combinations for A and B; and also there are <m>21^2 - 21</m> possible combinations for C and D (subtracting the 21 invalid outcomes where the same letter is picked for C and D).
		To decide the digits, there are 9 choices for the first digit and 10 each for the other three digits.
		Thus there are a total of <m>21^2 \cdot (21^2 - 21) \cdot (9 \cdot 10^3)</m> possible licence plate combinations.

		How many arrangements of the word PANINI 
		<ol label="(a)">
			<li>end with the letter P?</li>
			<li>start with three vowels?</li>
			<li>have all letters in alphabetical order?</li>
			<li>have all <em>vowels</em> in alphabetical order (but not necessarily beside each other)?</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</statement>
<solution>
	<p>
		b. The rearrangement should start A, I, and I, in some order, and end with P, N, and N in some order. These two decisions are independent of each other, so using <xref ref="prin-prod-rule"/> and <xref ref="prop-perm-repeat"/> we count a total of <me>\dfrac{3!}{2!} \times \dfrac{3!}{2!} = 9</me> rearrangements.

<statement>
	<p>
		Given a standard deck of cards (see <xref ref="eg-counting-standard-deck"/>), a <term>straight</term> is a hand of five different ranks in consecutive order.
		For example: 
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="40%" margins="auto">
		<p>
			4<m>\diamondsuit</m> 5<m>\heartsuit</m> 6<m>\clubsuit</m> 7<m>\clubsuit</m> 8<m>\diamondsuit</m>.
		</p>
	</sidebyside>
    <p>
    	Assume that straights can start with an ace (A-2-3-4-5) or 10 (10-J-Q-K-A) or any other numbered card, but not with any face card (J, Q, or K). 
		How many straights can be formed?
	</p>
</statement>
<solution>
	<p>The operation of <em>forming a straight</em> can be broken down into the following operations:</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a first card: there are 10 choices (A to 10).</li>
			<li>There is only one way to continue picking ranks. (If we start with a 6, then the next four cards must be 7, 8, 9, and 10.)</li>
			<li>Now we pick a suit for each of the cards we picked. There are four choices for each of the five cards, or a total of <m>4^5</m> suit combinations.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Hence using <xref ref="prin-prod-rule"/>, we can form a total of <m>10 \cdot 4^5</m> straights from a standard deck.

</solution>

			4<m>\spadesuit</m> 5<m>\spadesuit</m> 8<m>\spadesuit</m> J<m>\spadesuit</m> K<m>\spadesuit</m>
		</p>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		is a flush.
	</p>
	<p>
		<ol label="(a)">
			<li>How many flushes can be formed?</li>
			<li>How many flushes are also straights? (This hand is called a <term>straight flush</term>.)</li>

		A <term>full house</term> is a five-card hand with three cards of the same rank, plus two other cards of the same rank.

			<p>
				7<m>\heartsuit</m> 7<m>\diamondsuit</m> 7<m>\clubsuit</m> J<m>\heartsuit</m> J<m>\spadesuit</m>

	<p>
		is a full house.

		How many five-card hands are full houses?

<answer>
	<p>
		<m>\displaystyle \binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{1}\binom{4}{2}</m> or <m>\displaystyle {}_{13}P_{2}\binom{4}{3}\binom{4}{2}</m>.

<exercise>
<statement>
	<p>
		How many ways are there to draw a three-card hand from a standard deck of cards such that: 
		<ol label="(a)">
			<li>all of them are face cards (J, Q, K)?</li>
			<li>there are at least two numbered cards? (numbered cards are 2 to 10)</li>
			<li>there are at least two numbered cards, and exactly two red cards?</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</statement>
<solution>
	<p>
		b. The set of three-card hands that have at least two numbered cards can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: those that have exactly two numbered cards, and those that have exactly three numbered cards. Let's call these sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>; by <xref ref="prin-sum-rule"/>, the desired quantity is <m>|A| + |B|</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hands in <m>|A|</m> can be counted by first selecting two numbered cards. There are 36 of them (nine ranks and four suits each) so this step has <m>\binom{36}{2}</m> possibilities.
		Then, we pick the third non-numbered card from 16 options (A, J, Q, K; four suits each). Hence by <xref ref="prin-prod-rule"/> <m>|A| = \binom{36}{2} \cdot \binom{16}{1}</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, there are <m>|B| = \binom{36}{3}</m> ways to pick three numbered cards.
		Hence the total is <m>\binom{36}{2} \cdot \binom{16}{1} + \binom{36}{3}</m>.

			the hand 4<m>\clubsuit</m> 5<m>\clubsuit</m> 8<m>\diamondsuit</m> J<m>\diamondsuit</m> 5<m>\spadesuit</m> 9<m>\heartsuit</m> is invalid since it <em>does not</em> contain at most three suits.

			How many arrangements of the word ONTARIO:
			<ol label="(a)">
				<li><em>do not</em> have any two vowels beside each other?</li>
				<li>have all vowels in alphabetical order?</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
			(a). If no vowels can be beside each other, then the arrangement must have the pattern <em>vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel</em>.
			Hence to create an arrangement, we just need to:
			<ul>
				<li>Step 1: Arrange vowels A, I, O, O (<m>4!/2!</m> ways)</li>
				<li>Step 2: Arrange consonants N, T, R (<m>3!</m> ways)</li>

			where these two steps are performed independently of each other.
			Hence there are <m>\dfrac{4!}{2!} \cdot 3!</m> arrangements that satisfy the given condition.
		</p>
		<p>
			(b). The vowels have to be in the order AIOO from left to right, and this fixes the ordering of the vowels.

				<li>Step 1: Arrange consonants (<m>3!</m> ways)</li>

		Prove the identity <me>\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}</me> by counting the number of subsets of size <m>n</m> of the set <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\}</m>.
	</p>
</statement>
<solution>
<p>
		The right-hand-side is exactly the number of <m>n</m>-element subsets of the given set <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\}</m>.
</p>
<p>
	We need to show that the left-hand side counts the same collection of objects.
	Since there is a sum from <m>k = 0</m> to <m>k = n</m>, let's think about possible cases.
</p>
<p>
	The set <m>\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\}</m> has two types of elements: <m>a_i</m>'s and <m>b_i</m>'s.
	So let's take cases on how many of the <m>a_i</m>'s we pick when forming an $n$-element subset.
</p>
<p>
	Suppose that we pick <m>k</m> of the <m>a_i</m>'s. This means we need to take <m>n-k</m> of the <m>b_i</m>'s to create an <m>n</m>-subset. 
	Or equivalently, throw away <m>k</m> of the <m>b_i</m>'s and use whatever is left.
	By the product rule we can count this by multiplying <m>\displaystyle\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{k}</m>.
</p>
<p>
	For example, to include 3 of the <m>a_i</m>'s in our subset, we can pick them in <m>\displaystyle\binom{n}{3}</m> ways.
	Then we need to exclude 3 of the <m>b_i</m>'s to end up with <m>n-3</m> <m>b_i</m> elements to include in our subset and make it have <m>n</m> elements.
	There are <m>\displaystyle\binom{n}{3}\binom{n}{3}</m> ways to do this.
</p>
<p>
	It is a partition of the collection of all <m>n</m>-subsets to divide them into cases by how many of the <m>a_i</m>'s are picked, from <m>k = 0</m> to <m>k=n</m>. 
	Hence the sum rule gives the left-hand side:
	<me> \binom{n}{0}\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}\binom{n}{1} + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}\binom{n}{n} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2</me>.
	Therefore the equation
	<me> \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}</me>
	holds.

		<m>\displaystyle b^3 = 6\binom{b}{3} + 6\binom{b}{2} + b</m>
	</p>
</statement>
<solution>
	<p>
		Let <m>S</m> be the number of ordered triples of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,b\}</m>.
		Note that <m>|S| = b^3</m> by the Product Rule, since there are <m>b</m> choices per position, and elements can be repeated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now define the following sets:
		<ul>
			<li><m>A_1 = </m> the number of ordered triples that consist of only one element.</li>
			<li><m>A_2 = </m> the number of ordered triples that consist of two distinct elements.</li>
			<li><m>A_3 = </m> the number of ordered triples that consist of three distinct elements.</li>
		</ul>
		Then by the Sum Rule, <m>|S| = |A_3| + |A_2| + |A_1|</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To form an ordered triple with all three elements distinct, we first select three elements from <m>\{1,2,\ldots,b\}</m> (in <m>\binom{b}{3}</m> ways), then generate all permutations (there are <m>3! = 6</m> permutations). 
		Hence <me>|A_3| = 6\binom{b}{3}</me>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To form an ordered triple with two distinct elements,
		<ul>
			<li>We first select the two elements (in <m>\binom{b}{2}</m> ways)<mdash/>say we picked 1 and 2;</li>
			<li>We pick one of the elements to repeat (there are 2 choices)<mdash/>say 1;</li>
			<li>We count all permutations (there are 3 spots to choose from to place the non-repeated element)<mdash/>(1,1,2), (1,2,1), and (2,1,1) in our example.</li>
		</ul>
		Hence <me>|A_2| = 6\binom{b}{2}</me>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, <me>|A_1| = b</me> since there are <m>b</m> ordered triples of the form <m>(i,i,i)</m> for <m>i = 1,2,\ldots,b</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus the number of ordered triples <m>|S|</m> that can be formed from the set <m>\{1,2,\ldots,b\}</m> is 
		<me>b^3 = 6\binom{b}{3} + 6\binom{b}{2} + b</me>.
