	<p>
		When we are asked to <em>solve for <m>x</m></em> in an equation like <m>2x^2 + 4 = 36</m>, we know that we need to look for all values of <m>x</m> that satisfy that equation (<m>x = \pm 4</m>).
		What if we are asked to solve for <m>x</m> given a congruence? 
	</p>

	<example xml:id="eg-cong-solve-congruence">
		<title>Solving for <m>x</m></title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Solve for <m>x</m> in the congruence <m>2x \equiv 4 \Mod{9}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before looking at the solution, try it yourself first!
				What value(s) of <m>x</m> will satisfy the congruence?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				We need to find all values of <m>x</m> so that <m>9 \mid (2x - 4)</m>, or <m>9 \mid 2(x-2)</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since <m>\gcd(2,9) = 1</m>, by <xref ref="ex-review-bezout-euclid"/> we have <m>9 \mid (x-2)</m>, which means <m>x \equiv 2 \Mod{9}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this is no different from applying <xref ref="prop-cong-division"/> directly: since <m>\gcd(2,9) = 1</m>, we can safely divide both sides by 2 to obtain <m>x \equiv 2 \Mod{9}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This means that the congruence class <m>[2]</m> is the solution to <m>2x \equiv 4 \Mod{9}</m>, or that all integers in <m>\{\ldots,-16,-7,2,11,\ldots\}</m> satisfy the congruence. 
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		The final answer in the above example is typical of solutions to congruences: since we are working modulo <m>n</m>, answers will be congruence classes from <m>\{[0],[1],\ldots,[n-1]\}</m>. 
		Hence when asked to <em>solve for <m>x</m></em> given a congruence, you should express your answer as a congruence class (<m>[2]</m>), or as a statement of congruence like <m>x \equiv 2 \Mod{9}</m>, which makes the modulus explicit.
	</p>


	<example xml:id="eg-cong-solve-congruence-express">
		<title>Solve for <m>x</m></title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Solve the congruence <me>2x \equiv 6 \Mod{10}</me>, and express your answer using congruence classes of the original modulus.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				We can apply <xref ref="prop-cong-division"/> here to divide through by 2, and we get <me> x \equiv 3 \Mod{5}</me>.
				Modulo 10, this is the same as 
				<me>x \equiv 3 \Mod{10} \text{ and } x \equiv 8 \Mod{10}</me>.
				So the original congruence has two solutions in <m>\{[0],[1],\ldots,[9]\}</m>, namely <m>[3]</m> and <m>[8]</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<exercise xml:id="ex-cong-solve-for-x">
		<title>Solve Each Congruence</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Solve each congruence for <m>x</m>, paying special attention to your usage of <xref ref="prop-cong-division"/>.

					<li><m>3x \equiv 9 \Mod{10}</m></li>

				</ol>

	</exercise>

	<exercise xml:id="ex-cong-trial-error">
		<title>Solve Another One</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				<xref ref="prop-cong-division"/> cannot be used to solve the congruence
				<me>2x \equiv 3 \Mod{7}</me> since we cannot divide both sides by 2.
			</p>
			<p>
				Solve the congruence by trial-and-error.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				There are only 7 congruence classes to check, since we are working modulo 7.
			</p>
		</hint>
	</exercise>

	<p>
		We've seen that dividing both sides by a constant is not always possible.
		Recall instead that in the real numbers, division by a nonzero number <m>x</m> is the same as multiplication by its reciprocal <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>.
		The number <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> is sometimes called the <em>inverse</em> of <m>x</m> since they <sq>cancel</sq> each other out when multplied together.
	</p>
	<p>
		We define a similar concept for modular arithmetic.

	<definition xml:id="def-multiplicative-inverse">
		<title>Multiplicative Inverse</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Given natural numbers <m>a, m</m> such that <m>\gcd(a,m) = 1</m>, the number <m>b</m> is called a <term>multiplicative inverse</term> of <m>a</m> modulo <m>m</m> if 
				<me> ab \equiv 1 \Mod{m}</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can denote this inverse as <m>a^{-1} = b</m>, or by <m>a^{-1} \Mod{m}</m> to make the modulus explicit.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>
	
	<p>
		In <xref ref="def-multiplicative-inverse"/> we are really saying that any number in <m>[b]</m> is a multiplicative inverse of <m>a</m> modulo <m>m</m>, though we will usually be interested in finding that specific inverse that is also in the set <m>\{0,1,\ldots,m-1\}</m>.
		This can now be used when solving congruences of the form <me>ax \equiv b \Mod{n}</me> where <m>a \nmid b</m>.
		Instead of dividing both sides by <m>a</m> (which can't always be done), we multiply both sides by the inverse of <m>a</m>.
	</p>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Show that modulo 7, any number in <m>[4]</m> is a multiplicative inverse of 2.
