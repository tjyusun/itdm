    <title>Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion</title>
    <objectives>
        <ul>
            <li>State the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion and apply it to problems to compute set cardinalities (for combinations of two to four sets).</li>
        </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>
    	We first recall that in order to count the number of elements of a set <m>U</m> that <em>don't</em> satisfy a given condition, one can first count the number of elements that <em>do</em>, and then subtract from the cardinality of <m>U</m>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="eg-pie-divisible-3">
    	<title>Not Divisible by 3</title>
    	<statement>
    		<p>
    			How many integers in <m>U = \{1,2,\ldots,25\}</m> are <em>not</em> divisible by 3?
    		</p>
    		<p><alert>Solution</alert>
    		   			<notation>
                	<usage>\lfloor n \rfloor</usage>
                	<description>floor function</description>
            	</notation>
    			We first count the number of integers in the set that are divisible by 3: there are <me>\left\lfloor \frac{25}{3}\right\rfloor = 8</me> of them.
    		</p>
    		<p>   		
    			Note that the notation <m>\lfloor n \rfloor</m> denotes the <term>floor function</term>, which returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to <m>n</m>.
    		</p>
    		<p>
				Subtracting, we get <m>25 - 8 = 17</m> integers in the set <m>U</m> that are not divisible by 3.
				(Check that this is the correct number!)
			</p>
		
		</statement>
    </example>

    <p>
		Note that this solution can be expressed in terms of sets: if <m>U = \{1,2,\ldots,25\}</m> is the universe, and <m>A</m> is the set of integers in <m>U</m> divisible by 3, then the desired quantity is <m>|A^c|</m>, and <me>|A^c| = |U| - |A|</me>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What if we added a second condition to avoid?
	</p>

	<example xml:id="eg-pie-divisible-3-4">
		<title>Not Divisible by 3 or 4</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				How many numbers in <m>U = \{1,2,\ldots,25\}</m> are not divisible by 3 or 4?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Following the previous example, there are <m>8</m> integers in <m>U</m> that are divisible by 3.
				Also, there are <m>\lfloor \frac{25}{4} \rfloor = 6</m> integers in <m>U</m> not divisible by 4.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, after subtracting <m>25 - 8 - 6 = 11</m>, we've actually removed some numbers twice: those numbers that are divisible by <em>both</em> 3 and 4 (<ie/> divisible by 12).
				This means we need to <sq>add them back in</sq> again.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are <m>\lfloor \frac{25}{12} \rfloor = 2</m> of these numbers, so the correct total is <me>20 - 8 - 6 + 2 = 13</me> integers in the set that are neither divisible by 3 nor by 4.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		We can again write the solution to <xref ref="eg-pie-divisible-3-4"/> in terms of sets:
		<ul>
			<li><m>U = \{1,2,\ldots,25\}</m></li>
			<li><m>A_1 = </m> integers in <m>U</m> divisible by 3 <m> = \{3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24\}</m></li>
			<li><m>A_2 = </m> integers in <m>U</m> divisible by 4 <m> = \{4,8,12,16,20,24\}</m></li>
			<li><m>A_1 \cup A_2 = </m> integers in <m>U</m> divisible by either 3 or 4 <m> = \{3,4,6,8,9,12,15,16,18,20,21,24\}</m></li>
			<li>Desired set: <m>(A_1 \cup A_2)^c = </m> integers in <m>U</m> divisible by neither 3 nor 4.</li>

		Observe that when we subtract <m>|A_1|</m> and <m>|A_2|</m> from <m>|U|</m>, we are subtracting the elements in the intersection <m>A_1 \cap A_2 = \{12, 24\}</m> two times.
		So to determine the quantity <m>|(A_1 \cup A_2)^c|</m> we computed:
		<me> |(A_1 \cup A_2)^c| = |U| - |A_1| - |A_2| + |A_1 \cap A_2|</me>.

		The idea now is to replicate the 2-set scenario by first subtracting <m>|A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3|</m> from <m>|U|</m>, then to add back what was removed more than once.
		This means we have to add back <m>|A_1 \cap A_2|</m>, <m>|A_1 \cap A_3|</m>, and <m>|A_2 \cap A_3|</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, elements in the intersection of all three sets <m>A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3</m> have been removed three times and added back three times at this point.
		This means we should subtract <me>|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|</me> one more time so that we remove all the elements we need to remove.

		Now we can state the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (or PIE) in full generality.
		There are a number of ways to prove this, but the usual method is to show that each item belonging to none of the <m>A_i</m>'s contribute 1 to the total; while all other items contribute 0 to the total.
	</p>

	<theorem xml:id="thm-pie">
		<title>Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Given a universe <m>U</m> of items and subsets <m>A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n</m> of the items, the number <m>N</m> of items belonging to <em>none of these subsets</em> is given by
				<md>
					<mrow> N \amp = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,n\}} (-1)^{|S|} \left| \bigcap_{i\in S} A_i\right|</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp  = |U| - \sum_{i = 1}^n |A_i| + \sum_{1 \leq i \lt j \leq n} |A_i \cap A_j| - \sum_{1 \leq i \lt j \lt k \leq n} |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| + \cdots </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</statement>
		<proof>
			<p>
				Suppose that the element <m>x</m> is in none of the <m>A_i</m>'s.
				Then it is counted exactly once in the sum, in the first term <m>|U|</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now suppose that the element <m>y</m> is in some collection of <m>A_i</m>'s.
				Let <m>T = \{i : y \in A_i\}</m> be the set of indices of sets that contain <m>y</m>.
				(For example, if <m>y</m> is in <m>A_1</m>, <m>A_3</m>, and <m>A_4</m>, then <m>T = \{1,3,4\}</m>.)
				Then for each subset <m>S</m> of <m>T</m>, there is a corresponding term in the formula above.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the formula contributes a <m>+1</m> for intersections of even numbers of sets (or for <m>|S|</m> even); and a <m>-1</m> for intersections of odd numbers of sets (for <m>|S|</m> odd).
				Hence the total contribution for the element <m>y</m> is 
				<me>\sum_{S \subseteq T} (-1)^{|S|} = \sum_{k=0}^{|T|} (-1)^k\binom{|T|}{k}</me>.
				Applying <xref ref="thm-binomial"/>, we see that this is equal to
				<me>\sum_{k=0}^{|T|} (-1)^k\binom{|T|}{k} = \sum_{k=0}^{|T|} (1)^{|T|-k}(-1)^k\binom{|T|}{k} = \left( 1 + (-1) \right)^{|T|} = 0</me>,
				which is what we needed to prove.
