    <title>The Balls in Bins Formula</title>
    <objectives>
        <ul>
            <li>Derive the formulas for permutations and combinations with repetition (Balls in Bins Formula).</li>
            <li>Given a counting problem, recognize which of the above techniques is applicable, and use it to solve the problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>
        Consider the following example similar to <xref ref="eg-counting-mcq"/>.
	</p>
    <example xml:id="eg-counting-mcq-again">
    	<title>Multiple Choice, again</title>
    	<statement>
    		<p>
				A standardized multiple-choice test for high school students has 40 questions and 5 choices each (A to E). How many possible ways can the test be answered?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				For each question, there are 5 options, so using <xref ref="prin-prod-rule" />, there are a total of <m>5^{40}</m> possible ways to complete the test.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	
	<p>
		The operation in <xref ref="eg-counting-mcq-again"/> is called a permutation where <em>repetition</em> or <em>replacement is allowed</em>, since 
		<ul>
			<li> The order in which the answers are picked matters (<ie/> A-B-A is different from B-A-A); and</li>
			<li> Answers can be repeated. Imagine a bag with five balls labeled A to E; for each question we draw a ball from the bag, record the answer, and put it back.</li>
		</ul>
		We formalize this in the next result.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-perm-repetition">
    	<title>Permutations with repetition</title>
    	<statement>
    		<p>
    			If repetition is allowed, the number of permutations of <m>k</m> objects taken from a set of size <m>n</m> is <m>n^k</m>.
    		</p>
    	</statement>
    	<proof>
    		<p>
    			By <xref ref="prin-prod-rule"/>, since there are <m>n</m> possibilities for each of the <m>k</m> choices, the total number of ways to do so is <m>n^k</m>.
    		</p>
    	</proof>
    </proposition>

    <p>
    	There is also a counterpart for combinations in which the order does not matter, which the next example illustrates.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="eg-counting-rice">
    	<title>Rice Advice</title>
    	<statement>
    		<p>
    			Ten participants are recruited to join a focus group discussion on rice, after which they are asked to indicate their preferred type of rice among the following options:
    			<ul>
    				<li><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborio_rice">Arborio</url></li>
    				<li><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basmati">Basmati</url></li>
    				<li><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_rice">Jasmine</url></li>
    				<li><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshihikari">Koshihikari</url></li>
    				<li><url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutinous_rice">Malagkit</url></li>
    			</ul>
    			The participants gave their preferences anonymously so the researchers only know how many participants responded with each option.
				How many combinations of answers can the researchers obtain from the study?
    		</p>	
    		<p>
    			<alert>Solution</alert>
    			Since we are only concerned with the survey results, outcomes look like the following, where we only record how many respondents picked the corresponding option:
    		</p>
    		<sidebyside width="75%" margins="auto">
    			<p>Arborio -- 3, Basmati -- 5, Jasmine -- 2</p>
    		</sidebyside>
    		<p>
    			and
    		</p>
    		<sidebyside width="75%" margins="auto">
    			<p>Koshihikari -- 9, Malagkit -- 1</p>
    		</sidebyside>
    		<p>
				are examples of possible outcomes; we need to count how many there are in total.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that we cannot simply take permutations and then divide by an overcounting factor since how much we overcount by depends on the actual distribution of answers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead, we envision the process of collecting survey responses as placing balls into bins with labels `Arborio,' `Basmati,' and so on. (Imagine the participants physically placing their survey forms into one of five ballot boxes!)
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, the outcome [Arborio -- 3, Basmati -- 5, Jasmine -- 2] corresponds to the following distribution of balls into bins:
			</p>
			<sidebyside width="90%" margins="auto">
				<tabular halign="center">
					<row bottom="minor">
						<cell><m>\bullet \bullet \bullet</m></cell>
						<cell><m>\bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet</m></cell>
						<cell><m>\bullet \bullet</m></cell>
						<cell></cell>
						<cell></cell>
					</row>
					<row>
						<cell>Arborio</cell>
						<cell>Basmati</cell>
						<cell>Jasmine</cell>
						<cell>Koshihikari</cell>
						<cell>Malagkit</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</sidebyside>
			<p>
				This can also be represented concisely as the pattern 
				<me>\bullet \bullet \bullet \mid \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \bullet \mid \bullet \, \bullet \mid \, \mid</me>
				where the four vertical lines denote <sq>dividers</sq> in between each pair of adjacent bins. 
				Hence the problem of counting the number of possible outcomes is reduced to counting the number of arrangements of 10 <m>\bullet</m> and 4 <m>\mid</m> symbols, which is <me>\frac{14!}{10!\ 4!} = \binom{14}{4}</me>
				by <xref ref="prop-perm-repeat"/>.
			</p>

    	</statement>
    </example>

    <exercise xml:id="ex-counting-rice-1">
    	<title>Rice Advice Exercise</title>
    	<statement>
    		<p>
				Following <xref ref="eg-counting-rice"/>, express each survey outcome as a pattern of dots <m>\bullet</m> and bars <m>\mid</m>, or vice-versa.

    <p>
    	This is called a <em>combination where repetition is allowed</em>, since
    	<ul>
    		<li>The order in which objects are picked <em>does not matter</em> (<ie/>, A-B-A is the same as B-A-A); and</li>
    		<li>Objects can be repeated.</li>
    	</ul>
    	As we saw in <xref ref="eg-counting-rice"/>, the number of <m>k</m>-combinations taken from a set of size <m>n</m> when repetition is allowed is equal to the number of ways we can distribute <m>k</m> balls into <m>n</m> bins.
		This gives the following formula:

    <theorem xml:id="thm-comb-replace">
    	<title>Balls in Bins</title>
    	<statement>
    		<p>
    			If repetition is allowed, the number of combinations of <m>k</m> objects taken from a set of size <m>n</m> is 
    			<me>\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \binom{n+k-1}{n-1}</me>.
				This is also equal to the number of ways one can distribute <m>k</m> indistinguishable balls into <m>n</m> bins.
    		</p>
    	</statement>
    	<proof>
    		<p>
    			The total number of these combinations is equal to the number of ways to arrange <m>k</m> bullets (<m>\bullet</m> symbols; one for each object), and <m>n-1</m> bars (<m>\mid</m> symbols; to delineate bins):
				<me> \underbrace{\bullet \ \bullet \ \cdots \ \bullet}_{k \text{ copies}}\ \underbrace{\mid \ \mid \ \cdots \ \mid}_{n-1 \text{ copies}}</me>,

		A nice application of the <xref ref="thm-comb-replace" text="custom">Balls in Bins Formula</xref> is counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions to equations of the form <me>x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = k</me>.

				The number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to distribute <m>k = 10</m> balls into <m>n = 5</m> bins, labeled <m>x_1</m> to <m>x_5</m>.

		<solution>
			<p>
				b. In the context of <xref ref="ex-counting-apples"/>, <m>x_1 \geq 4</m> means that the first student must get at least 4 apples, so we start off by giving 4 to the variable <m>x_1</m>.
				We can model this by defining a new variable

				where <m>y_1</m> represents <em>how many more apples</em> above 4 we assign to <m>x_1</m>.

				We can rearrange to get <m>x_1 = y_1 + 4</m> and substitute this into the original equation to get the new system

						y_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 73 \amp \\ y_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 12, x_4 \geq 9 \amp
						\end{cases}

				Then the same process can be repeated for <m>x_3</m> and <m>x_4</m>, resulting in the system

						\begin{cases}
						y_1 + x_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 52 \amp \\ y_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, y_3 \geq 0, y_4 \geq 0 \amp
						\end{cases}
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this point it is the same kind of system as in <xref ref="prop-nonnegative"/>, hence we can apply it directly to get the desired number, <m>\displaystyle\binom{56}{53}</m>.
