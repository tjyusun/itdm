    The first step in learning to write mathematics well is to <em>read</em> it well

    When you open a journal article you may be surprised to find that sometimes there aren't as many symbols as you would expect.

    Note the heavy use of English words to make connections, guide the reader, manage the flow of the argument and paper.

    Hence it is tricky sometimes to tell apart when an English word is used in a mathematical way or as part of the prose of the argument.

    Examples are therefore, if, only if. 
    The most egregious is probably the word or.
    This can mean an exclusive or (would you like coffee or tea?) or an inclusive or (

In MAT102 you discussed the language of logic, and saw how mathematical arguments depend on spoken language (English) in order to communicate ideas clearly (<xref ref="bib-fuchs-102"/>).



So in this section we will first go over some of the logical connectors that you 

Some of these are:
Therefore
Implies

When we want o say we are making an assumption

assume that

Therefore, 
Thus,

When we want to write "if p" then q

Reading math is different form reading English. (Prose or poetry)

The language of mathematics is precise

<p>
    To read mathematics is very different from reading a novel or a magazine article in that you need to pay extra attention to how terms are defined and used, as well as to the logical structure of the text. 
    This is because mathematics is a precise language, and a word used in an English sentence may mean something different than when used in a proof, for instance.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look at a short proof.
</p>

<example xml:id="eg-reading-1">
    <title>Short Proof Example</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Let's prove the statement: An integer is even if and only if its cube is even.
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Proof</alert>
        </p>
           <p>
        (<m>\Rightarrow</m>) Let <m>m</m> be an integer. First, we show that <m>m</m> being even implies <m>m^3</m> is even.

        If <m>m</m> is even, then we can write <m>m = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
        Then,
        <md>
            <mrow>m^3 \amp = (2k)^3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 8k^3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3)</mrow>
        </md>.
        Since <m>k</m> is an integer, then <m>4k^3</m> must be an integer as well. 
        This shows that <m>m^3</m> is even.
    </p>
    <p>
        (<m>\Leftarrow</m>)
        Next, we show that <m>m^3</m> even implies <m>m</m> is even.
        To do this we prove the contrapositive: If <m>m</m> is odd, then <m>m^3</m> is odd.
    </p>
    <p>
        If <m>m</m> is odd, then there is an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>m = 2k + 1</m>.
        Then
        <md>
            <mrow>m^3 \amp = (2k+1)^3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k) + 1</mrow>
        </md>.
        Since <m>k \in \mathbb{Z}</m>, then <m>4k^3 + 6k^2 + 3k</m> is an integer as well.
        Therefore <m>m^3</m> is odd.
    </p>
    <p>
        This completes the proof. 
    </p>

    </statement>
</example>

<!--
<p>
    In <xref ref="eg-reading-1"/> we proved an equivalence between two statements; recall that <sq><m>p</m> if <m>q</m></sq> is the implication <sq>if <m>p</m>, then <m>q</m></sq>, or in symbols, <m>p \Rightarrow q</m>.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, <sq><m>p</m> only if <m>q</m></sq> is the implication <sq>if <m>q</m>, then <m>p</m></sq> (or <m>q \Rightarrow p</m>).
</p>
<p>
    So, in <xref ref="eg-reading-1"/> we needed to prove two implications.

    <title>Questions about <xref ref="eg-reading-1"/></title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            After reading the proof in <xref ref="eg-reading-1"/> answer the following questions:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>What was/were being proven?</li>
                <li>Explain how the variable <m>m</m> is being used in the proof. What does it represent?</li>
                <li>Explain how the quantity <m>k</m> is being used in the proof. What does it represent?</li>
                <li>What definitions were used, either implicitly or explicitly?</li>
                <li>What were the key words/terms that helped you understand the structure of the proof?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </statement>
</exercise>

<p>
    For longer proofs involving multiple objects it is sometimes challenging to keep track of which ones represent arbitrary quantities, which ones have been fixed, and so on.

To write well, one must read well.
Reading math: what's the difference?
Sometimes words in sentences mean something different.
You need to distinguish when a word means something mathematically or simply in prose.

E.g. when someone says "differentiate between injective and surjective functions" they don't mean to take the derivative (the mathematical definition) but just the more commonly-used definition of to "separate" or "distinguish."

Some English words match up reasonably well with their corresponding mathematical concepts, for instance "partition," or "even"

Much of mathematical writing involves implications. 
You've seen this before, in MAT102. 
Statements of the form
If p, then q.

But proofs are rarely linear. 
Here's an example

(Take from section 1.4)
e.g. if a odd then a^3 odd

Okay pretty straightforward.

How about this?

(more complicated, multiple implications implying another implication)
Ah, slightly harder to parse. 
Need to go through each step in the proof WHILE keeping big picture in mind.

Big picture: What are the assumptions? What is being proven? What results are being used?
Details: What is this line saying? Why does the next line follow?

In this exercise you will talk with your group members and simply work through a proof, answering some guide questions.

1. What are the assumptions? Differentiate between implicit and explicit assumptions.

    1. What is being proven? Give the assumptions and conclusion.
    2. Are any implicit assumptions being made?
    3. What do the symbols mean?
    4. Which of the sumbols are arbitrary, and which are fixed/defined in relation to some other quantity?
