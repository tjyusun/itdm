    The first step in learning to write mathematics well is to <em>read</em> it well

    When you open a journal article you may be surprised to find that sometimes there aren't as many symbols as you would expect.

    Note the heavy use of English words to make connections, guide the reader, manage the flow of the argument and paper.

    Hence it is tricky sometimes to tell apart when an English word is used in a mathematical way or as part of the prose of the argument.

    Examples are therefore, if, only if. 
    The most egregious is probably the word or.
    This can mean an exclusive or (would you like coffee or tea?) or an inclusive or (


    Throughout our years in school we've learned to read more and more complex material: from learning ABC's and how to spell our names, to children's books, short stories, long-form novels. 
    No one really questions this literary emphasis on reading (and writing)


    Before one can write and communicate mathematics well, one needs to be able to <em>read</em> mathematics.

    Activities
    * Give students definitions and proofs to read and ask them to answer guide questions.
    [Definition]
    1. What kind of definition is this?
    2. 
    [Proof]
    1. What is being proven? Give the assumptions and conclusion.
    2. Are any implicit assumptions being made?
    3. What do the symbols mean?
    4. Which of the sumbols are arbitrary, and which are fixed/defined in relation to some other quantity?
    5.
