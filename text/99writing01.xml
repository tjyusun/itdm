<title> Introduction to <latex/> </title>

    <objectives>
        <ul>
        	<li>Use <url href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</url> and <latex/> to typeset mathematics.</li>
     	</ul>
    </objectives>

<p>
    The overwhelming majority of mathematics articles and texts are typeset using <latex/> <xref ref="bib-latex"/>, a document preparation system developed specifically for producing scientific and technical documents. As students in the mathematics programs you are expected to know how to use <latex/>. The availability of <alert>free</alert>, online editors like <url href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</url> provides a low barrier to entry.
</p>
<p>
	In <latex/> the primary focus is on the <em>content</em> and not the <em>format</em> of your document.
	So you will be working on a plaintext file, typing commands that tell <latex/> what to do when your document is compiled (similar to programming).
</p>
<example xml:id="eg-latex">
	<title><latex/> example</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
			In <latex/>, the following code generates the text below.
			Can you guess what the commands mean by looking at the output?
		</p>
		<p>
			<alert>Code:</alert>
			<cd>
Let's prove that 
\[ \sum_{i=1}^n i = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}\]
using mathematical induction.

The base case for $n = 1$ is clearly true,
since $1 = \frac{1(2)}{2}$.

Now assume that the claim is true for $n = k$;
that is,
\[ \sum_{i=1}^k i = 1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \dfrac{k(k+1)}{2}.\]
	</cd>
	</p>
	<p>
		<alert>Output:</alert>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's prove that 
		<me>\sum_{i=1}^n i = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}</me>
		using mathematical induction.
	</p>
	<p>
		The base case for <m>n = 1</m> is clearly true, since <m>1 = \frac{1(2)}{2}</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now assume that the claim is true for <m>n = k</m>; that is,
		<me> \sum_{i=1}^k i = 1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \dfrac{k(k+1)}{2}</me>.

</example>

	<p>
		Try this out yourself! 
		Go to <url href="https://overleaf.com">https://overleaf.com</url> and create an account.
		Then start a new blank project, give it the name <em>First Project</em>, and copy and paste the code above, just below the <c>\section{introduction}</c> line. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Press <c>CTRL + Enter</c> to compile the document.
		The output should appear on the right.
	</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-overleaf-1">
				<caption>Overleaf document</caption>
    			<image source="figs/latex-example-overleaf1.png" width="90%"><description>Overleaf document.</description></image>
    </figure>
    <figure xml:id="fig-overleaf-2">
    			<caption>Compiled output</caption>
    			<image source="figs/latex-example-overleaf2.png" width="90%"><description>
    			Output document.</description></image>
    </figure>
	<p>
		You may have noticed that there is some extra text that tells <latex/> what kind of document you are preparing (article), what the title is (First Project), author's name, and so on.
		Everything above the <c>\begin{document}</c> line is said to be the <alert>preamble</alert> of the document<mdash/>here you will usually issue commands to <latex/> about global formatting options, packages you want installed, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact if you look at your <em>First Project</em> document, in line 14 there is an error message, denoted by the red X.
		Hover your cursor over it to see the message: <c>Undefined control sequence</c>.
		The issue here is that the command <c>\dfrac{ }{ }</c> that we used to generate <me>\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}</me> is not in <latex/> by default. 
		So the fractions don't actually appear in the output.
	</p>
	<p>
		To remedy this we need to tell <latex/> to load the <c>amsmath</c> package so we have access to all its commands, including <c>\dfrac{ }{ }</c>.
		Just add the line <c>\usepackage{amsmath}</c> to the preamble.
		It can be anywhere, but it is generally good practice to place all <c>\usepackage</c> commands together, so type it in line 3.
		Now compile again by pressing <c>CTRL + Enter</c> and the error message should disappear.
		The output on the right should be correct as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most mathematics documents start by loading the packages
		<ul>
			<li><c>amsmath</c> for general mathematical features</li>
			<li><c>amsthm</c> for theorem-like environments</li>
			<li><c>amssymb</c> for even more symbols</li>
		</ul>
		so you can just load all of them at the beginning of each document you create.
	</p>
	<p>
		You also probably noticed that placing dollar signs <c>$  $</c> around text renders that text as mathematics.
		Placing <c>\[ \]</c> around text (or double dollar signs <c>$$   $$</c>)renders that as <em>display mathematics</em>, centered in its own line.
		Have a look at <url href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Symbols">this website</url> for a list of commonly-used math symbols and try using Overleaf to typeset a number of results from these notes or another math textbook. 
		Have fun and explore! 
		This is where your <latex/> journey begins.

			Here are some other helpful resources:
			<ul>
				<li>David Richeson also has a PDF quick guide to <latex/> available <url href="https://divisbyzero.com/teaching/a-quick-guide-to-latex/">on his website</url>.</li>
				<li>Overleaf also has an <url href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">introductory guide</url>.</li>
				<li><url href="https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</url> for searching commands for symbols.</li>
				<li><url href="http://www.tug.org/texworks/">TeXworks</url>, if you would like to install <latex/> on your computer. (optional! only if you really want to...)</li>

<!--The proposed module will involve the development of a start-up guide to installing LaTeX on one’s own system (if desired) and creating a first document; a reference list of common LaTeX commands; source files and course-specific templates. Source files for all assignments will also be provided to the class. Short videos will also be created to introduce students to LaTeX, as a companion to the start-up guide. The instructor will offer additional LaTeX-dedicated office hours for the first three weeks; teaching assistants are expected to be able to answer LaTeX-related questions in their own office hours throughout the semester.

An “Assignment 0” will be due at the end of the second full week of classes where students just have to typeset a short mathematical proof in LaTeX, type an academic integrity statement for the course, and answer some questions about the syllabus. Students will be given a few bonus marks if they submit Assignment 1 or the first Portfolio draft in LaTeX.
