<title>Writing Mathematics, Part II</title>

<p>
	Okay, it's your turn to try writing a clear, concise proof of a statement!
	As we have seen, the use of English words makes proofs more approachable and understandable. Here's a small sample of commonly-used phrases in mathematical proofs. Note the use of the plural <em>we</em> instead of the singular <em>I</em>.
</p>
<sidebyside widths="50% 50%" margins="auto" valign="middle">
    <p>
    <alert>Declare intentions</alert>
    <ul>
        <li>We will prove...</li>
        <li>We want to show that...</li>
        <li>In order to prove... we...</li>
        <li>At this point we need to find...</li>
        <li>We consider the following cases...</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <alert>Clarify implications</alert>
    <ul>
        <li>Since... then...</li>
        <li>Because..., we have...</li>
        <li>Therefore/thus/hence...</li>
        <li>This means that...</li>
        <li>The previous statement implies...</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</sidebyside>

<p><alert>Explain steps</alert>
<ul>
    <li>By assumption, we know that...</li>
    <li>By simplication/manipulation,rearranging,...</li>
    <li>Because of property/theorem/definition, we have...</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Moreover<mdash/>and this is something that takes some practice to get used to<mdash/>mathematical formulas and equations, when used in English sentences, need to be treated as part of the grammar.
	A complete sentence is one that expresses a complete idea. For example, <em>TJ baked brownies.</em> is a complete sentence, while <em>baked brownies</em> is not. (The latter is called a phrase, or a fragment.)
</p>

<activity xml:id="ex-writing-grammar">
	<title>Complete sentence or not?</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
			For each statement below, decide whether it is a complete sentence or not.
		</p>
		<p>
		<ol label="(a)">
			<li>x^2.</li>
			<li>x^2 = 9.</li>
			<li>Because <m>A \subseteq B</m>.</li>
			<li>6 ways of rearranging the letters of the word DOG.</li>
			<li>We will manipulate <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.</li>
			<li><m>-1 \in \mathbb{N}</m>.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>

<p>
	Something else to note is that the two-column proof method of writing statement and reason beside each other is <em>not</em> a best practice.
	Besides the fact that it is not really used by math practitioners, these are just lists of bullet points that sometimes even obfuscate the logical links among the parts of a solution.
	They are sometimes useful, like for organizing your thoughts, but generally it is better form to write in complete sentences.
