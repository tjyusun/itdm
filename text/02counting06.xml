    <title>Summary</title>
    <p>
        In this chapter we developed techniques applicable to a wide variety of counting problems.
		One should be able to decide which technique to use by determining if order matters or not; if repetition is allowed or not; if the underlying set is a multi-set or not.
		<xref ref="table-summary-counting"/> summarizes these considerations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that the <xref ref="prin-sum-rule" text="custom">Sum Rule</xref> and <xref ref="prin-prod-rule" text="custom">Product Rule</xref> underpin all these formulas, and that there is often more than one solution to any given counting problem.
