<p>In recognition of the unusual position we're all in, I'd like to make a number of commitments to you:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>In all aspects of the course, I will be clear and organized, and reduce as many barriers to your access and learning that I can.</li>
<li>I will be reasonably available to help you with your learning.</li>
<li>I will do my best to listen when you speak. Your voices are important to me.</li>
<li>I will treat you with respect and dignity, and make our class a safe learning environment for you and your peers.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">In return, all I ask is that:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>You uphold academic integrity in everything you do.</li>
<li>You sincerely attempt to engage actively in the course (material, classes, tutorials, and discussions) and submit assessments by their due dates.</li>
<li>You treat your classmates, TAs and instructor with respect and dignity, and make the class a safe learning environment for everyone.</li>
<li>You expect to make mistakes, and view them as opportunities to learn and grow.</li>
<li>You reach out to me and communicate any thoughts or concerns you may have about the course, or anything that you want me to know.</li>
</ul>
