<p>If a pair of integers \(a, b\) among the six have the same remainder when dividing by 8, then their difference \(a-b\) is divisible by 8, and we are done.</p>
<p>So assume that all six integers have distinct remainders when dividing by 8. Construct the five pigeonholes \(\{0\},\{1,7\},\{2,6\},\{3,5\},\{4\}\) and place each of the six numbers in the pigeonhole corresponding to its remainder.</p>
<p>By PHP, one of these pigeonholes must have two numbers. That is, summing those two numbers gives a sum that is divisible by 8.</p>
