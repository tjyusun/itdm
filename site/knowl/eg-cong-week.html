<p>Modulo 7, the numbers 26 and 47 are congruent because \(7 \mid (26-47)\text{.}\) This means 26 and 47 are ‘equivalent’ under this particular relation.</p>
<p>One way to see this is the fact that if today were Sunday, then 26 days from today it will be Friday, and 47 days from today is also a Friday. Abstracting only the property we care about (remainder when divided by 7) allows us to generate conclusions like this without having to manually count 47 days forward.</p>
<p>As another example, if today were Sunday, then we can confidently claim that 2020 days from today, it will be Thursday. This is because \(2020 \equiv 4 \Mod{7}\text{,}\) and four days after Sunday is Thursday. (We've effectively removed as many 7's as possible to reduce the calculation.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-congruence.html#eg-cong-week">in-context</a></span>
