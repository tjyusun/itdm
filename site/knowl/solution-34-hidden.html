<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose there are \(n\) people in the group. Then each person can have \(0, 1, \ldots, \text{ or } n-1\) friends among the group. This is still \(n\) pigeonholes, so we cannot apply PHP yet.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Observe that it cannot happen that someone has no friends, and someone else has \(n-1\) friends. (If a person has \(n-1\) friends, then every other person has at least one friend.) Hence there are only \(n-1\) possible numbers of friends among the \(n\) people, which means two of them must have the same number of friends, by the PHP.</p>
