<p>You are working as a delivery person for a company selling medicinal herbs online. On April 20th, a particularly busy day, you have to make deliveries to Brampton, Burlington, Cambridge, and Guelph; the company has its distribution center in Mississauga, which is where you live as well. Given the table of distances below, can you determine the route that will take you from the distribution center in Mississauga, to each city exactly once, then back home, such that total distance traveled is minimized?</p>
