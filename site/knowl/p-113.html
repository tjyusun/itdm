<p>For the test papers in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-counting-test-papers.html" title="Checkpoint 2.1.5: Exam Counts">CheckpointÂ 2.1.5</a> there are certainly multiple ways to do this. One method that TAs use is to form piles of ten, and count how many piles are produced. This is actually more similar to the socks example than you might think. Separating the huge pile of papers into groups of 10 has the same goal as separating socks by colour: one just has to add the numbers in each pile together in the end (which, if all piles have 10, is an easy calculation).</p>
