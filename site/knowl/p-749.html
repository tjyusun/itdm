<p>Six graph theorists are at a conference. During a coffee break, each of them starts counting how many coauthors they have among the group (so 0 means that person has not written a paper with anyone in the group; 5 means that person has written a paper with everyone in the group). When they scribble the numbers down on a napkin, they get:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
3,2,2,2,1,1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Prove that this is impossible, so someone must have made a mistake counting.</p>
