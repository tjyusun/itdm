<p>If all followers among TJ's three accounts are different people, then we could just add \(200 + 2500 + 12000 = 14700\) to get the total number of unique followers. However this is very possibly not the case!</p>
<p>For instance, if we knew that a hundred of TJ's followers on his personal account also followed the puppy auto-tweeter, then the number of unique followers among all three accounts is no more than 14600. This is lower if there is more overlap.</p>
<p>The <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prin-sum-rule.html" title="Principle 2.1.9: Sum Rule">Sum Rule</a>does not apply becase the three sets of followers do not form a <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-partition.html" title="Definition 2.1.8: Partition">partition</a> of the set we want to count (the first condition fails).</p>
