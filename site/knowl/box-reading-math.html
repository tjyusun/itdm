<ul class="disc">
<li>Use pen and paper, or digital tools, to write down your thoughts as you read the proof. Draw diagrams, emphasize key points, highlight confusing steps that need further study.</li>
<li>
<p>Don't rush through the material. Ask yourself questions to check understanding, for example:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Are there any words whose meaning is vague or unclear to me?</li>
<li>Do I believe the proof?</li>
<li>Are there other arguments that could have worked?</li>
<li>Can I simplify the idea to make it more understandable?</li>
<li>Why did the author choose this way of explaining it?</li>
<li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also think about the big picture. What were the assumptions? What was being proven? How does this proof and the methods used fit into the rest of the text?</li>
<li>Finally, try explaining it to someone else. Having discussions with other classmates will usually reveal whether one actually understands the material or not.</li>
