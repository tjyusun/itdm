<p>Towards a contradiction, suppose that each person gets at most one slice only. Then they will eat at most only 6 slices among them, leaving the pizza unfinished. This is a contradiction, so there must be one person who eats at least two slices.</p>
<p>Observe that this proof does not deny the possibility of multiple people getting two slices: it is quite possible that four of the friends ate a slice each, and the two others ate two slices each. It is also possible that one person ate three slices, while the five remaining friends ate a slice each.</p>
<p>In either case, one person ate at least two slices.</p>
