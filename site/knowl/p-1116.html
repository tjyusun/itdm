<ul class="disc">
<li>Take notes: use pen and paper, or digital tools, to write down your thoughts as you read the proof. Draw diagrams, write an outline, emphasize key points, highlight confusing steps that need further study.</li>
<li>Look for key words to help you understand the logical structure of the argument: <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">therefore</em>, <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">implies</em>, <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">since</em>, <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">assume</em>, <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">thus</em>, and so on.</li>
<li>Mathematical proofs often rely on previous results, so you will frequently have to look up past propositions or theorems. You'll also notice that some results are more useful than others.</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of propositions and theorems: it is not always clear what the difference is between them (and lemmas, properties, principles, and so on…).</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Theorems are the most important results in a mathematical text or paper.</li>
<li>Propositions are results that are lesser in importance.</li>
<li>Lemmas are minor results that are specifically used to prove theorems or other results.</li>
<li>Corollaries are direct consequences (e.g. a special case) of theorems.</li>
<li>Conjectures are mathematical statements that are not yet proven, but they ‘make sense’, i.e. there is some consensus that they could be true. The <a class="external" href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TwinPrimeConjecture.html" target="_blank">Twin Prime Conjecture</a> is a famous example.</li>
<li>Principles are similar to theorems, but are usually deemed to be more ‘fundamental’ in nature, or generally applicable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't rush through the material. Ask yourself questions to check understanding, for example:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>Are there any words whose meaning is vague or unclear to me?</li>
<li>Do I believe the proof?</li>
<li>Are there other arguments that could have worked?</li>
<li>Can I simplify the idea to make it more understandable?</li>
<li>Can I come up with my own examples based on this definition or property?</li>
<li>Why did the author choose this way of explaining it?</li>
<li>and so on…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also think about the big picture. What were the assumptions? What was being proven? How does this proof and the methods used fit into the rest of the text?</li>
<li>Finally, try explaining it to someone else. Having discussions with other classmates will deepen your own understanding of the results (and will usually reveal whether one actually understands the material or not).</li>
