        <title>Welcome to the Course!</title>
        <p>
            <alert>September 2020</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hello all! <em>waves</em>
            My name is <alert>TJ</alert>, and this semester I will be joining you in your journey to discover and learn about discrete mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's been a wild ride this year, and we're only 2/3 of the way through!
            We have all been affected in different ways by many different events, and it is understandable that you may not be in the best mindset to study, especially since you are doing this from your homes.
            You also miss seeing people, hanging out with your friends, going to the library on campus<ellipsis/>I mean, you probably miss waiting for your <em>Thai Express</em> order from the Davis Food Court!
        </p>
        <p>
            I hear you, and I personally would like nothing else but to be able to see your faces in person this Fall term. 
            Unfortunately we've had to make some adjustments, and here we are<mdash/>meeting each other through words on a screen instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recognition of the unusual position we're all in, I'd like to make a number of commitments to the class:
            <ul>
                <li>In all aspects of the course, I will be clear and organized, and reduce as many barriers to access and learning that I can.</li>
                <li>I will be reasonably available to help you with your learning.</li>
                <li>I will do my best to listen when you speak. Your voices are important to me.</li>
                <li>I will treat you with respect and dignity, and make our class a safe learning environment for you and your peers.</li>
            </ul>
            In return, all I ask is that:
            <ul>
                <li>You uphold academic integrity in everything you do.</li>
                <li>You sincerely attempt to engage actively in the course (material, classes, tutorials, and discussions) and submit assessments by their due dates.</li>
                <li>You treat your classmates, TAs and instructor with respect and dignity, and make the class a safe learning environment for everyone.</li>
                <li>You expect to make mistakes, and view them as opportunities to learn and grow.</li>
                <li>You reach out to me and communicate any thoughts or concerns you may have about the course, or anything that you want me to know.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, there <em>will</em> be technology difficulties and failures throughout the term, for both you and me.
            (In the Winter I had to cancel a class because my internet went out for one whole day.)
            This is to be expected, and we will manage.
        </p>
